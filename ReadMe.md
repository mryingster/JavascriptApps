Mike's Rad Web Apps
-------------------

This is a collection of javascript applications I've written over the years. They mainly fall into 3 categories:

* Finished - These are applications that have a feature set that I am happy with
* In development - These are applications I have started, but still require more effort to call complete
* Ideas - These are highly underdeveloped applications where I am exploring an idea, but haven't committed to seeing it through to the end yet.

Feel free to enjoy these.
